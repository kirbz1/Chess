- implement more advanced movement (castling, backrank pawn, en passant, king can't move into check, pawns can only move 2 on first go)
- implement a timer
- maybe implement welcome screen with option for 2 player or 1 player (vs ai) (different time modes)
- implement flip board mechanism for 2 player mode
- implement ai, beginner > more advanced (minimax based on some evaluation function of positions)

use pytorch etc some sort of NN to evaluate a position?
